# 🎭 Actors Classification using Deep Learning (CNN) | Face Detection & Recognition 🚀

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements **Actors Classification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** from scratch. The model is trained to classify actors based on their facial images using **RetinaFace** for face detection and **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning.

## 🔹 Features  
✅ Face detection using **RetinaFace**  
✅ Image preprocessing & augmentation  
✅ CNN model built **from scratch** using **TensorFlow & Keras**  
✅ Classification of actors like **Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Shahrukh Khan**  
✅ Model training, evaluation, and testing  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of actor images, split into **training** and **testing** sets.

## 🚀 Model Training & Evaluation  
To train the model, we use:  
✔️ **CNN model** with multiple convolutional layers  
✔️ **Adam optimizer** with learning rate scheduling  
✔️ **Categorical Cross-Entropy loss**
